- 👋 Hi, I’m @kolluria
- 👀 I’m interested in developing cloud applications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning application deployment using kubernetes apart from the tech stack that I'm working on. I'm also trying to get better at Golang.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting. I don't believe in sticking to only the things that I know. Always happy to expand my horizons.
- 📫 Reach out to me on my official email `kolluria@netapp.com` or my personal email `kanvstnrn@gmail.com`
